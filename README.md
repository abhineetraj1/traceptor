Our hosted website is a sophisticated AI-driven platform that revolutionizes the job search and career development process. It employs advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze uploaded resumes, extracting key information such as skills, experience, and education. The system then utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation techniques to match users with highly relevant job opportunities and hackathons. Full latency processing ensures real-time suggestions, with the platform continuously recalibrating recommendations as users update their profiles. The AI-powered resume optimization tool uses sentiment analysis and keyword optimization to provide constructive feedback, enhancing visibility to recruiters. A comprehensive application tracking system with a user-friendly dashboard allows efficient management of job applications and hackathon registrations. The platform also incorporates a community engagement feature, leveraging social graph algorithms to foster networking opportunities among users. Additionally, it includes a resource center with dynamically updated content on resume writing, interview preparation, and networking strategies, curated by AI-based content recommendation systems. This multifaceted approach, combining AI technologies such as deep learning, predictive analytics, and natural language generation, creates a holistic ecosystem for career advancement, empowering users to navigate the competitive job market effectively


## Features
Utilizing advanced AI technologies, it ensures full latency in processing user data to deliver accurate recommendations. Key features include:

*   AI-driven resume optimization: Suggests better wording and skills to enhance resumes.

*   Job matching: Uses NLP and recommendation systems to connect users with relevant job listings.

*   Hackathon discovery: Identifies hackathons aligned with user profiles to boost career growth.

*   Customizable tools: Offers resume templates and tracks job applicationsÂ seamlessly.

## Workflow
The Traceptor application provides an intuitive user interface where users can upload their resumes for job and hackathon opportunities based on their skills. Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a home screen featuring a description of the app's functionality and an "Upload your resume" button. After selecting a resume through a file picker, the app communicates with a backend service hosted at Flask server to process the uploaded PDF. A loading dialog appears during the file upload, and once successful, a confirmation dialog is shown. Users can also access a team section to view the GitHub profiles of contributors, and external links open through the url_launcher package. Future enhancements include displaying results from the backend in a structured format, implementing better error handling for API failures, and improving the overall UI/UX. The app uses a consistent deep red color theme to maintain visual coherence.

A separate Selenium bot will be developed to scrape job listings and hackathon opportunities from various websites on a routine basis. This bot will automatically navigate through job boards and hackathon platforms, extract relevant information such as job titles, company names, locations, and registration links, as well as hackathon details like event names, descriptions, dates, and registration URLs. The scraped data will be stored and processed for integration with the Traceptor application, ensuring that users always have access to up-to-date job openings and hackathon challenges based on their skills. The bot will be scheduled to run periodically, ensuring the data remains current and accurate.
